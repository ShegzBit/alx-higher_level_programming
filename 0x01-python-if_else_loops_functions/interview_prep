create a new node
loop through the list
at point prev node data is less than new node data and new node data is less than prev node next data
new node next = prev node ->next
prev node->next = new node

insert = 17
list = 1,3,5,6,8,80

or where new node data less than first data
if temp data < prev data insert at beginning

and where temp is the greatest and should be at the end
if temp data > new head data and new head next == NULL
